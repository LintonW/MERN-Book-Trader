## Software Requirements

Project Description : 
An application where users can buy and sell secondhand books. 
The user can add, edit or delete their secondhand book to the database as well as
search the database to look up information on a secondhand book that has been posted by another user. 
However, the user cannot add, edit or delete another users data.
The admin will be allowed to add, edit or delete any users data in the database.

System Architecture :
The architecture that will be used is the MERN stack.

This 3-tier architecture allows for a simple and quick development process using only JavaScript & JSON, 
this means that JavaScript is used both by the client-side and server-side code. 

```
MongoDB (Database)
This NoSQL database is perfect for the task at hand. MongoDB stores data in the form of JSON/BSON, 
which works perfectly with React, Express and Node. Storing, manipulating and representing data 
is made easy with MongoDB and fits well with AGILE development.  

Express and Node (Backend)
Using Node.js and the Express framework makes it easy to handle URL routing and HTTP requests and 
responses. For the task at hand, this is essential when performing CRUD operations which will 
be the key aspect in this application. It is also essential when it comes to communicating 
with the database. 

React (Frontend)
This javascript library for building dynamic client-side applications is fast, simple and scalable.
React is used to develop the user interface as well as manipulating data on the backend.

Styling 
I have chosen to use create-react-app and not Next.js. I have also decided to use simple CSS 
and no frameworks as the application is relatively simple to develop and is not too complicated.
React and CSS are more than capable.  	 	

```

The deployment will be handled by Heroku. The reason for this is because Heroku is fully managed and is perfect 
for modern apps. To deploy, manage and scale is done so with ease and as a developer this is optimal.

The MERN stack is capable of developing the task at hand. Not only is it capable
but it excels in all aspects and makes for easy development. JSON data flows seamlessly from the backend to the 
frontend and as only JavaScript is used it makes the process more simpler.

	the users are > 1000

Security

```


User Stories :
1. As a user, I want to be able to sell my secondhand book, to make some money
2. As a user, I want to search for a secondhand book, to purchase it at a reduced price
3. As a user, I want to see the details of the seller, to make an informed choice
4. As a user, I want to see which secondhand book I searched for is the cheapest, so I can save money
5. As a user, I want to enjoy using the software, so I donâ€™t get frustrated.


How I Am Going To Stand Out : 
```
In my research, I have only found one similar application. It is called "Textbook Trader". 
Textbook trader allows users to sell and buy used textbooks particularly from UNISA. 
The average user is most likely a student studying at UNISA. 

I plan to stand out by making an application where a user can sell or buy used books and 
is more generalized where the average user could be anyone who loves books and likes to read. 
The benefit of my app is that new books can be quite expensive, buying a secondhand book
can be cheaper. My idea is similar to OLX and Facebook Marketplace however it 
targets a specific niche - secondhand books. 

I believe that this idea is unique and can be used as a viable idea in real life. 
The simplicity of the application justifies its development.
